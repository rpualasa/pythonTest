2. Update Resource: Write a script that updates a resource and validates the response.
3. Fetch User ID: Using the /posts endpoint, write a script that can fetch the user id for a
given title. If the title is not found, the script should return an error.
4. Fetch User Data: Using the /posts/{id} endpoint, write a script that can fetch data for a
given user. The id to be used will come from the previous test based on the title passed
